# 🔧 Vercel Build Fix

## Issue Identified
The build failed with a permission error:
```
sh: line 1: /vercel/path0/frontend/dashboard/node_modules/.bin/vite: Permission denied
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 126
```

## Root Cause
The `vercel.json` configuration was using the deprecated `builds` property which conflicts with Vercel's automatic build detection.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Updated `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist", 
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Commit and Push Changes**
```bash
git add frontend/dashboard/vercel.json
git commit -m "Fix Vercel build configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Redeploy on Vercel**
- Go to your Vercel project dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" or trigger a new deployment
- The build should now succeed

### 3. **Alternative: Manual Redeploy**
If automatic redeploy doesn't work:
- Go to Vercel dashboard
- Click "Settings" → "General"
- Scroll down to "Build & Development Settings"
- Ensure these are set:
  - **Framework Preset**: Vite
  - **Root Directory**: `frontend/dashboard`
  - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
  - **Output Directory**: `dist`
  - **Install Command**: `npm install`

## 🔍 What Changed

- **Removed**: Deprecated `builds` configuration
- **Added**: Explicit build commands
- **Kept**: SPA routing configuration

## ✅ Expected Result

The build should now complete successfully and your NeuroLearn frontend will be deployed!
