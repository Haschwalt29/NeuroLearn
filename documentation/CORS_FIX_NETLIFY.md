# 🔧 CORS Fix for Netlify Frontend

## Issue Identified
Your frontend is successfully deployed on Netlify (`neurolearn1.netlify.app`) but can't communicate with your backend due to CORS policy:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://neurolearn-7hk8.onrender.com/api/auth/signup' 
from origin 'https://neurolearn1.netlify.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## ✅ Fix Applied

Updated the backend CORS configuration in `aitutor_backend/__init__.py` to allow your Netlify domain:

### **Production CORS Settings:**
- `https://neurolearn1.netlify.app` (your current domain)
- `https://neurolearn.netlify.app` (alternative)
- `https://*.netlify.app` (all Netlify subdomains)
- Plus existing Render domains

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **1. Commit and Push Backend Changes**
```bash
git add aitutor_backend/__init__.py
git commit -m "Update CORS configuration for Netlify frontend"
git push origin main
```

### **2. Redeploy Backend on Render**
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Find your `neurolearn-backend` service
- Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
- Wait for deployment to complete

### **3. Test Frontend-Backend Communication**
- Go back to `https://neurolearn1.netlify.app`
- Try the signup form again
- Check browser console for CORS errors (should be gone!)

## 🔍 What Changed

- **CORS Configuration**: Added Netlify domains to allowed origins
- **Environment-Specific**: Different CORS settings for production vs development
- **Flexible**: Supports multiple Netlify subdomains

## ✅ Expected Result

After redeploying the backend:
- ✅ Frontend can communicate with backend
- ✅ Signup/login forms work
- ✅ All API calls succeed
- ✅ Real-time features (Socket.IO) work

## 🎯 Your NeuroLearn Platform Status

- **✅ Backend**: Deployed on Render (`neurolearn-7hk8.onrender.com`)
- **✅ Frontend**: Deployed on Netlify (`neurolearn1.netlify.app`)
- **⚠️ CORS**: Fixed, needs backend redeploy

**After redeploying the backend, your full-stack NeuroLearn platform will be live!** 🎉
