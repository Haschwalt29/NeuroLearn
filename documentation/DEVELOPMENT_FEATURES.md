   - Toggle to show/hide the emotion detector
   - Development mode indicator

3. **Enhanced Mood Indicator**

### How to Use:

1. **Start the System:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start Backend
   python -m aitutor_backend.wsgi
   
   # Terminal 2: Start Frontend
   cd frontend/dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the Interface:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Login or sign up
   - The Live Emotion Detector will be visible at the top of the Dashboard

3. **Test Emotion Detection:**
   - Click "Start Camera" to begin webcam feed
   - The system will detect emotions every 2 seconds
   - Watch the real-time emotion display
   - Check the browser console for detailed logs

4. **Development Controls:**
   - Use the floating settings button (bottom-right) to toggle the detector
   - View emotion history in the right panel
   - Monitor confidence scores and detection accuracy

### Console Logs:

The system provides detailed console logging:
- `üé≠ Emotion Detection Result:` - Shows detected emotion and confidence
- `‚ùå Emotion detection failed:` - Shows any API errors
- `Emotion detected:` - Callback from the detector

### API Endpoints Used:

- `POST /api/emotion` - Sends base64 image for emotion detection
- Requires JWT authentication
- Returns `{ emotion: "happy", confidence: 0.92 }`

### Troubleshooting:

1. **Camera Permission:** Allow camera access when prompted
2. **Authentication:** Make sure you're logged in (JWT token required)
3. **Backend Running:** Ensure backend is running on port 8002
4. **Console Errors:** Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Development Notes:

- The emotion detector is only visible in development mode
- It can be toggled on/off via the DevSettings panel
- All emotion data is logged to console for debugging
- The interface updates in real-time as emotions are detected

This makes it easy to verify that the emotion detection system is working correctly during development!
